# ChampionTrackPro — Cursor Rules

## Design/DA
- Dark lab cockpit; glassmorphism layers; soft cyan/blue glow.
- Colors: #0E1528 (bg), #4A67FF (accent), #00E0FF (data), #FFFFFF (text), #2B2E36 (surface).
- UI font: Inter/SF Pro. Brand font (Cinzel-like) ONLY in the wordmark.
- Buttons: gradient cyan→blue, generous radii, soft shadows.
- Tagline: THE TRAINING INTELLIGENCE.

## Structure
- Expo + React Native + TypeScript.
- Firebase v9 modular; single init in src/lib/firebase.ts.
- All new code under src/: app, components, features, lib, theme, types, stitch_components.
- Reuse existing config; no duplicate Firebase init.

## Scope (MVP)
- Roles: admin, athlete.
- Admin: imports team schedule (ICS), can create events for team.
- Athlete: sees team events, submits personal questionnaire per event (3 sliders).
- Admin reads data; charts later.

## Quality
- Type-safe, no any, minimal deps. Keep logic and navigation intact.
- Respect tokens from src/theme/tokens.ts.
